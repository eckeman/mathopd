CHANGES between the current beta (1.4) and the last
stable (1.3) version of Mathopd.

A ScriptUser can be defined in a control block. Mathopd will
change its identity to that of the ScriptUser right before
execution.

Scripts can still be run as the owner of the script. This
is governed by the RunScriptsAsOwner parameter (set to 'On'
to enable the old behaviour.)

Note that ScriptUser overrides whatever value is active
for RunScriptsAsOwner, and that no scripts will be run
if neither variable is set and the server is run as root.

LogFormat keyword has been added to generate custom log
formats. See config.c for details. Additional keywords
BytesRead, BytesWritten, ContentLength, Ctime, Method,
Referer, Status, Uri, UserAgent, Version are also added.
The HTTP version can now also be logged.
Thans to Peter Leven for suggesting these changes.

Never return a 403 error code, except if the client's IP
address is explicitly denied access.

Symlinks checking removed; it seems impossible to do
this safely so we might as well dump it.

Do not log a timeout if a client disconnects after the
timeout period.

Add debugging info to get_path_info.

Always open() any file requested. If a file's mtime is
equal to or less then the If-Modified-Since value, but
we do not have read permission on the file, return an
error rather than a 'not modified.'

Return 404 rather than 400, if check_path() fails.

Do not open a custom error file if the request method is
HEAD.

The configuration file can now be specified on the
command line rather than fed through standard input.

Standard input, output and error are not closed
if mathopd is started with the -n flag.

ASCII NUL characters are not allowed in HTTP
headers, as these might upset the various
string-handling routines.

A new AllowedOwners keyword has been added. It
can be used as follows:

 Virtual {
  Host www.an.example
  Control {
   AllowedOwners {
    User foo
    User bar
    Group foo
   }
  }
  Control {
   Alias /
   ...

In this example, files that get retrieved for www.an.example
must be owned by either user foo, user bar or group foo.

Note that mathopd maps the usernames and groupnames
at startup, so if you somehow change the userid or groupid
in /etc/passwd or /etc/group you must restart the server.

AllowedOwners is inheritable.

If you have want to allow access regardless of file
ownership, use

  Control {
   AllowedOwners {
    World
   }
  }

If mathopd is started with the -n flag, diagnostic
messages are logged to standard error as well as the
ErrorLog.

The Refresh: keyword has been removed while I search
for something better.

The DefaultName: keyword has been removed.

REMOTE_PORT and SERVER_ADDR environment variables are
available to CGI scripts.

For CGI programs invoked via 'External' specialties
PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED point to the request-uri
and the physical pathname of the script respectively.
This appears to make more sense.

SCRIPT_NAME is now just the pure script name, without
extra info past a trailing slash.

A TCPNoDelay flag has been added that can be set inside
a server definition. When set, the TCP_NODELAY option is
set for all incoming connections. This appears to slightly
increase responsiveness.
