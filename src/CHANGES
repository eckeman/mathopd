CHANGES between mathopd-1.2pl8 and mathopd-1.3.

More or less in reverse order of importance.

- Two extra items are logged: bytes sent to client and bytes received
  from client. (Bytes sent through CGI/External modules are not
  logged yet.)

- Multiple "Host" keywords per Virtual servers are now allowed.
  (Yippee.) In addition, a NoHost keyword has been added to indicate
  virtual servers that get activated when no Host: header is sent.

- A "Dump" specialty has been added. Mathopd no longer dumps to
  the error log.  Dumping has been more or less obsoleted, since
  Mathopd now logs the exact number of bytes sent and received
  for each virtual server in the transaction log.

- Client hostnames can now be double-checked by the CGI/External
  module, a bit like what tcpwrap does. This behaviour is off by
  default; use the DNSLevel keyword to turn it on. DNSLevel can
  also be used to completely turn off reverse DNS lookups. The
  keyword operates at the "Control" level so different websites,
  or even different directories can have dissimilar DNSLevel
  settings.

- The "Export" and "ChildLog" keyword now operate at the "Control"
  level, making it possible to customize these settings across
  websites/directories (if anyone wants to.)

- A "Dummy" specialty has been added. This does nothing, it only
  returns a 404 error. You can use this to "hide" files on your
  server.

- The "ExactMatch" flag can be used in combination with aliases.
  If it is set to On, the control block in which the alias lives
  will be used only if the request-uri exactly matches the
  alias.

- Support for encrypted password files has been reinstated.

- The size of input buffer can be changed with InputBufSize.

- "NoApply" has been added to complement "Apply".

- Negative numbers in configuration files are now illegal.

- Port numbers are checked for being in the [1..65535] interval.

- Stopped child processes are reported.

- The Makefile now contains an "all" and an "install" target.
