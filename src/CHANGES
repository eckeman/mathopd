CHANGES between mathopd-1.3pl2 and mathopd-1.4b3

A ScriptUser can be defined in a control block. Mathopd will
change its identity to that of the ScriptUser right before
execution.

Scripts can still be run as the owner of the script. This
is governed by the RunScriptsAsOwner parameter (set to 'On'
to enable the old behaviour.)

Note that ScriptUser overrides whatever value is active
for RunScriptsAsOwner, and that no scripts will be run
if neither variable is set and the server is run as root.

All debugging hooks have been removed for now.

1.4b3:

LogFormat keyword has been added to generate custom log
formats. See config.c for details. Additional keywords
BytesRead, BytesWritten, ContentLength, Ctime, Method,
Referer, Status, Uri, UserAgent, Version are also added.
The HTTP version can now also be logged.
Thans to Peter Leven for suggesting these changes.
