Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use the stable version instead.

We are currently at 1.3b3. Changes relative to the previous
beta release:

  - ChildLog is now a control item, so you can have different
    childlogs for different servers, etc.
 
  - A 'dummy' specialty has been added. Request for dummies always
    return 404 errors. This can be used to hide certain files that
    you don't want people to see.

  - A handler for SIGQUIT has been added. Use this signal to
    toggle debugging on a live server.
