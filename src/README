Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use that stable version instead.

No changes have been made yet, apart from the fact that the RCS
release for all source files has been incremented.

Cheers
Michiel
