Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use the stable version instead.

Mathopd 1.3b1 was a private release for testing purposes; so I've
jumped straight to 1.3b2.

Differences between 1.2pl6 and 1.3b2: (not much, really)
 
  - support for poll() has been removed. This is not because I
    do not like poll(), on the contrary, but I do not like the
    mess it has created in the code. I decided that either
    select() or poll() had to go. Since poll() is not quite
    so common I'm afraid we're now stuck with select() for a
    while.
 
  - support for encrypted userfiles is back again for the time
    being.
