Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use the stable version instead.

We are currently at 1.3b7. Changes to the last beta:

	Mathopd now returns an "Allow" header if the
	status is 405.

	Error messages now have the error number
	prominently displayed again.

	The "NoApply" keyword has been added to complement
	"Apply". The configuration file syntax has been
	tightened a bit: Allow and Deny are now legal only
	inside Access lists, and Apply and NoApply are legal
	only inside Clients lists.

	The InputBufSize keyword has been added.

	Negative numbers are no longer allowed in the
	configuration file.

	The Port number for servers is now sanity-checked.

	The 'params' member of the request structure has been
	removed.

	A new keyword "DNSLevel" has been added. This only
	affects CGI/External programs and determines when
	the REMOTE_HOST environment variable will be set
	in child processes. The keyword can be used inside
	Control blocks.

	Let i be the IP address of the client. Let h
	be the name corresponding to i. Let c
	be the canonical name of h, and let i_1..i_n
	be the list of IP addresses corresponding to h.

	In other words:
		h = gethostbyaddr(i)
		c, i_1 ... i_n = gethostbyname(h)

	If DNSLevel == 0, REMOTE_HOST is never set.
	If DNSLevel == 1, REMOTE_HOST is always set to h.
	If DNSLevel == 2, REMOTE_HOST is set to h, if one
	of the ip addresses i_1 ... i_n is equal to i. Otherwise,
	REMOTE_HOST is not set.
	If DNSLevel > 2, REMOTE_HOST is set to h if h is
	equal to c, and if one of the ip addresses i_1 ... i_n
	is equal to i. Otherwise, REMOTE_HOST is not set.

	DNSLevel defaults to 1, for backward compatibility.
	The author recommends always setting DNSLevel to 3.

	"Export" is now defined inside Control blocks, not
	globally.

	The targets 'all' and 'install' are added to the
	Makefile.
