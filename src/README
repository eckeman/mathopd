Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use the stable version instead.

We are currently at 1.3b4. Changes relative to the previous
beta release:

  - Major changes in request.c:

    Log the url as sent by the client instead of the decoded url.

    We now read all the header lines before starting to look at
    the first line. This allows us to include more data for diag-
    nostic logging. We ignore empty lines sent by clients and
    lines that consist of just one word. (Since these really are
    errors, these are logged.) The first request line (i.e. the
    "GET / HTTP/1.0" bit) is split up a bit differently in order
    to work around stupidities like spaces in URLs.
