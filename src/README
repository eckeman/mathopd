This is the README for the current beta release of the Mathopd
HTTP server.

We are currently at 1.3b9. Changes to the last beta:

base64.c:
	pwok returns false if EncryptedUserFile is on and crypt() is not used

config.c:
	a "NoHost" keyword has been added; this makes it possible to
	do things like
		Virtual {
			Host www.an.example
			Host www.another.example
			NoHost
			Control {
		...
	virtual servers with NoHost will be used if no Host: header is
	received.

If no bugs are found, this beta will be released as Mathopd-1.3
