Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use the stable version instead.

We are currently at 1.3b9. Changes to the last beta:

	A "NoHost" keyword has been added. This can be used
	to denote a virtual host that is used when no Host:
	header is sent by the client.

To-Do:

	Handle and send 'chunked' data.
	Get rid of MSG_PEEK hack.
	Keep track of data sent and received via children.
	Pass all HTTP headers to children, combining multiple
	headers (e.g. Cookie) if necessary.
	Do CGI properly.
