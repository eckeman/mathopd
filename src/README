Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use the stable version instead.

We are currently at 1.3b3. Changes relative to the previous
beta release:

  - ChildLog is now a control item, so you can have different
    childlogs for different servers, etc.
