Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use the stable version instead.

We are currently at 1.3b8. Changes to the last beta:

	Multiple "Host" keywords can now be used inside
	Virtual blocks.

	Logging now takes place after the transfer, instead
	of before. This allows us to keep more accurate track
	of actual data transferred. Two extra columns are added:
	bytes read and bytes written.
