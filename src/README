Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use the stable version instead.

We are currently at 1.3b5. Changes to the last beta:

    A new file, log.c, has been added to the source.
    This files does all the request logging. It uses an
    array of things that we should log. The array is
    currently hardcoded in such a way that the logging
    output looks exactly similar to the `old' log format.
    Logging can be customized in later versions.
