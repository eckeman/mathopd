Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use that stable version instead.

Differences between 1.2pl6 and 1.3b1: (not much, really)
 
  - support for poll() has been removed. This is not because I
    do not like poll(), on the contrary, but I do not like the
    mess it has created in the code. I decided that either
    select() or poll() had to go. Since poll() is not quite
    so common I'm afraid we're now stuck with select() for a
    while.
 
  - support for encrypted userfiles is back again. This should
    not be a problem unless people start distributing binary
    releases with crypto hooks to or from places where this is
    not allowed. Since I do not make any binary distributions
    myself, I do not really consider this a problem for *me*.
    If you feel this is not correct, contact me immediately and
    we'll see what needs to be fixed. Until then, crypto is back
    in.
