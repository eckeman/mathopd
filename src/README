Work has been started on a new, experimental, release of Mathopd.
Please see the README that comes with the stable release
to find out exactly what Mathopd is. If you are planning to run
Mathopd in a production environment, and you are not the same
person as the author, you should stay away from this code, and
use the stable version instead.

We are currently at 1.3b4. Changes relative to the previous
beta release:

    A new keyword: "ExactMatch"

    An alias that has this keyword is processed if and only if the
    request-uri exactly maps to the alias. This allows one to do
    funny things like

     Control {
       Alias /
       Location http://some.other.server
     }
     Control {
       Alias /
       Location /home/www/docs
       ExactMatch On
       IndexNames { index.html }
     }

    There are other applications for this but I leave them to
    your imagination for now. :)

    Log the url as sent by the client instead of the decoded url.
    This prevents messy urls like /%09hahaha from currupting our
    log file.

    We now read all the header lines before starting to look at
    the first line. This allows us to include more data for diag-
    nostic logging. We ignore empty lines sent by clients and
    lines that consist of just one word. Whether this is actually
    a good thing is another matter but this was the easiest way
    to code things.

    The first request line (i.e. the "GET / HTTP/1.0" bit) is
    split up a bit differently in order to work around stupidities
    like spaces in URLs.
