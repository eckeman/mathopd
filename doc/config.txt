Keyword: AcceptMulti
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Flag
Default: On
Desc:    By default, Mathopd will try to accept more connections
         after it has accepted one, until the accept call indicates
         a blocking condition. When there is hardly any traffic,
         this means that an extra system call is made each time
         a connection comes in. If you don't want that behaviour,
         use this keyword to turn it off.

Keyword: Access
Where:   Control
Type:    Block
Default: Inherits from previous Access blocks
Desc:    The Access block can be used to allow or deny access to
         specific IP addresses. Mathopd has a default-allow policy,
         so if you have no Access blocks, access is allowed to anyone.
         If you do have Access blocks, make sure that you put the
         access entries in the correct order. Mathopd scans
         access blocks from the bottom up until a match is found.
         Example:

            Access {
              Deny 0/0
              Allow 127.0.0.1/32
            }

         This will allow access to 127.0.0.1, while denying access to
         anyone else.

            Access {
              Allow 127.0.0.1/32
              Deny 0/0
            }

         The above will in fact block access to everyone, even 127.0.0.1
         This is because the scan for access entries starts at the bottom,
         and 0/0 matches any address.

Keyword: Address
Where:   Server
Type:    Address
Default: 0 (any address)
Desc:    If you want a server to listen on a specific address, rather
         than any address, use this keyword.
         Example:

           Server {
             Address 127.0.0.1
           }

Keyword: Admin
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Default: (none)
Desc:    The value of this keyword, if set, is displayed in HTTP error
         messages.

Keyword: Alias
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    Control blocks that contain an Alias keyword are used in
         URI-to-path translation. A block with an Alias keyword must
         have one or more Location keywords as well. Generally
         speaking, Mathopd scans Control blocks until it can match
         the directory part of the Request-URI with the alias.
         Scanning starts in the Virtual server and continues
         upwards.
         Example:

           Control {
             Alias /
             Location /usr/share/doc/handbook
           }

          You can do some tricks with aliases, one of which is the
          tilde-hack:

            Control {
              Alias /~
              Location public_html
              UserDirectory On
            }

         Note that the order of aliases in the configuration matters.
         In general you should put your leasts specific aliases, like
         the root, first.

Keyword: Allow
Where:   Access
Type:    Network
Desc:    Allow is used to specify a network that is allowed access to
         a resource. It is most useful in combination with Deny keywords.

Keyword: AllowDotfiles
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Default: Off
Desc:    Normally, Mathopd will not serve any file if any part of its
         pathname contains '/.', for security reasons.
         If the AllowDotFiles flag is set, there restrictions are lifted
         a bit, although constructions like '/./', '/../', etc. are
         still disallowed.
