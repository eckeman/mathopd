Keyword: AcceptMulti
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Flag
Default: On
Desc:    By default, Mathopd will try to accept more connections
         after it has accepted one, until the accept call indicates
         a blocking condition. When there is hardly any traffic,
         this means that an extra system call is made each time
         a connection comes in. If you don't want that behaviour,
         use this keyword to turn it off.

Keyword: Access
Where:   Control
Type:    Block
Default: Inherits from previous Access blocks
Desc:    The Access block can be used to allow or deny access to
         specific IP addresses. Mathopd has a default-allow policy,
         so if you have no Access blocks, access is allowed to anyone.
         If you do have Access blocks, make sure that you put the
         access entries in the correct order. Mathopd scans
         access blocks from the bottom up until a match is found.
         Example:

            Access {
              Deny 0/0
              Allow 127.0.0.1/32
            }

         This will allow access to 127.0.0.1, while denying access to
         anyone else.

Keyword: Address
Where:   Server
Type:    Address
Default: 0 (any address)
Desc:    If you want a server to listen on a specific address, rather
         than any address, use this keyword.
         Example:

           Server {
             Address 127.0.0.1
           }

Keyword: Admin
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Default: (none)
Desc:    The value of this keyword, if set, is displayed in HTTP error
         messages.

Keyword: Alias
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    Control blocks that contain an Alias keyword are used in
         URI-to-path translation. A block with an Alias keyword must
         have one or more Location keywords as well. Generally
         speaking, Mathopd scans Control blocks until it can match
         the directory part of the Request-URI with the alias.
         Scanning starts in the Virtual server and continues
         upwards. Scanning stops as soon as a match is found.

         Example:

           Control {
             Alias /
             Location /usr/share/doc/handbook
           }
           Control {
             Alias /boland
             Location /usr/home/boland/www
           }

         The above is an example of two aliases. Note that the order
         of the aliases matters: if you switch the two around, unexpected
         things will happen (the more specific alias will be obscured by
         the '/' alias.)

Keyword: Allow
Where:   Access
Type:    Network
Desc:    Allow is used to specify a network that is allowed access to
         a resource. It is most useful in combination with Deny keywords.

Keyword: AllowDotfiles
Where:   Control
Type:    Flag
Default: Off
Desc:    Normally, Mathopd will not serve any file if any part of its
         pathname contains '/.', for security reasons.
         If the AllowDotFiles flag is set, there restrictions are lifted
         a bit, although constructions like '/./', '/../', etc. are
         still disallowed.

Keyword: AnyHost
Where:   Virtual
Desc:    If a virtual server has this keyword, it will match on any Host:
         header that is sent by the client. Other virtual servers that have
         an explicit Host name are still checked, so the 'AnyHost' virtual
         server will only be used as a last resort.

Keyword: Apply
Where:   Clients
Type:    Network

Keyword: BufSize
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Desc:    The server uses two buffers to store incoming and outgoing data.
         The size of the outgoing buffer is determined by the value of the
         BufSize keyword. The default value is 12288 (12Kbytes.)
         Larger buffers can lead to less system calls, but also increase the
         amount of memory used by the server process.

Keyword: BytesRead
Where:   LogFormat

Keyword: BytesWritten
Where:   LogFormat

Keyword: ChildLog
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    If a child process, such as a CGI script, writes a message to its
         standard error file descriptor (fd 2) it will end up in the file 
         designated by the ChildLog keyword. If no ChildLog is specified,
         error output is mixed with any other output from scripts.

Keyword: Location
Where:   Control
Type:    String
Desc:    The Location keyword is used in combination with the Alias keyword.
         There are two types of locations: physical locations and 'redirects'.
         A physicial location is anything that starts with a slash ('/'),
         a redirect is anything else.
         When mathopd processes a request, the Alias that matches the
         Request-URI sent by the client is replaced with its corresponding
         location. For example, in the following situation

           Control {
             Alias /doc
             Location /usr/share/doc/handbook
           }

         when a client requests a URI '/doc/x11.html', the server will
         send the contents of /usr/share/doc/handbook/x11.html.
         When the location is a redirect, the server will send a HTTP
         '302' status response, which should cause the client to redirect
         to the desired location. Example:

           Control {
             Alias /secure
             Location https://an.example
           }

         In this example, when a client request a URI '/secure/test.html',
         the server will redirect the client to 'https://an.example/text.html'.

         More than one Location keywords can be used with one alias. Mathopd
         will rotate the locations on a round-robin bases. Example:

           Control {
             Alias /download
             Location http://mirror1.an.example/download
             Location http://mirror2.an.example/download
             Location http://mirror3.an.example/download
           }

         The first client that request something under /download will be
         redirected to mirrior1.an.example, the second client to mirror2,
         the third to mirror3, the fourth to mirror1, and so on.

Keyword: Log
Where:   Global
Type:    String
Desc:    This keyword determines where the access log is stored. The
         server creates one and only one access log, regardless of the
         number of (virtual) servers. The log file must be writeable
         by the user the server runs as. If no log file exists, Mathopd
         will try to create one. In that case, the server must also have
         write access to the directory that will contain the log file.
         There are some hacks that make it easier to maintain logs
         for distinct time periods. Before Mathopd tries to open the
         log file, it will expand any '%' constructs in the log file
         name, similar to date(1) and strftime(3). For example, if

           Log /var/mathopd/log.%Y%m%d

         is used, Mathopd will expand the %Y, %m and %d in the file
         name, to something like /var/mathopd/log.20020831
         Mathopd automatically rotates the log file every hour.
         If during this process Mathopd cannot create a new log file
         for any reason, it will continue to append to the old log.
         The format of the access log is determined by whatever is
         specified in the LogFormat block (see below.)

Keyword: LogFormat
Where:   Global
Type:    Block

Keyword: LogGMT
Where:   Global
Type:    Flag
Default: Off
Desc:    Normally time stamps in log files are in local time. If
         LogGMT is set to 'On', time stamps are in GMT. Note that
         this setting also affects naming of log files when
         '%' constructions are used. (See the 'Log' keyword.)

Keyword: Method
Where:   LogFormat

Keyword: Name
Where:   Server
Type:    String
Desc:    The value of this parameter is passed to CGI programs in the
         SERVER_NAME environment variable, if no match is found for a
         virtual server using Host headers.

Keyword: NoApply
Where:   Clients
Type:    Network

Keyword: NoHost
Where:   Virtual
Desc:    A Virtual server that has the "NoHost" keyword will be used when
         no Host header is sent by the client.

Keyword: NumConnections
Where:   Tuning
Type:    Integer
Default: 64
Desc:    The NumConnections parameter is the #1 tunable for Mathopd. It
         determines how many simultaneous requests can be handled.
         The default is probably too low for high-traffic systems.
         Mathopd uses a fixed block of memory for each connection, so
         the higher you set this tunable, the more memory the server
         will use.

Keyword: PIDFile
Where:   Global
Type:    String
Desc:    The PIDFile keyword specifies a file in which the server will
         record its process ID, for tracking purposes.
