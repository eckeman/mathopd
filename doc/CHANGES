Changes between Mathopd 1.5 and Mathopd 1.6

IPv6 support has been added. It is not clear yet how the Access
and Clients functionality should be ported. Therefore Access and
Clients has been temporarily disabled.

request.c:

	The '*' character in Error40[134]File and
	AutoIndexCommand is replaced with the current
	value of the Host header.

	If the Error*File is not present, the original
	HTTP status code is sent back, rather than a 500
	error.
