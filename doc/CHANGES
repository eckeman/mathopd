Changes between Mathopd 1.4 and Mathopd 1.5b1

cgi.c:

	All headers are now converted into HTTP_ environment
	variables, not just some.

config.c:

	The `NumHeaders' keyword has been added to the Tuning
	block. It determines the maximum amount of headers that
	are passed to child programs using HTTP_ variables.

core.c:

	If connections are active, call poll() with a timeout
	of one minute, rather than infinity. This should take
	care of connections that remain stuck after shutdown.

mathopd.h:

	Added: request_header structure, nheaders and headers
	members to request structure; num_headers to tuning.

	Removed: cookie from request structure.

request.c:

	Store all headers in the r->headers array (up to a maximum
	number, determined by NumHeaders.)
