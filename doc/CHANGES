Changes between Mathopd 1.5 and Mathopd 1.6

The '*' character in Error40[134]File and AutoIndexCommand is
replaced with the current value of the Host header.

If the Error*File is not present, the original HTTP status code
is sent back, rather than a 500 error.

IPv6 support has been added. It is not clear yet how the Access
and Clients functionality should be ported. Therefore Access and
Clients has been temporarily disabled.

The 'family' keyword has been added. This sets the address family
for a particular server. It must be either 'inet' or 'inet6'.

The 'options' keyword starts a block that sets various socket
options for a server. See config.txt for details.
