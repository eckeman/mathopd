How to build and install Mathopd.

The quick and dirty way: enter the src/ directory, and type

    ./configure
    make

If the make succeeds, become root and type

    make install

This will install the server into /usr/local/sbin.

If you want to do things a little more sophisticated, you
should create an object directory, chdir into it and type

    $(srcdir)/configure

where $(srcdir) is the directory where the sources live.
Then proceed with make, make install as before.

There is no documentation or sample configuration yet,
sorry about that. It should appear in the next beta.
